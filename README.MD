# 8085 Simulator [educational purpose]
This is intended to be a reimplementation of 8085 simulator, written in C++. There are already enough simulators in the market like gnusim8085. This project intends to do basic operations supported by common simulators like GUI, writing of code(mnemonics), live inspections of registers and memory, etc. 

## Development.
Development of the core simulator is in progress. GUI can be developed on par or later. Anyone wishing to contribute are requested to fork this repo and send a Pull Request. Thanks for your contributions.

## Getting Started.
This project uses meson build system. Install meson : `sudo apt install meson`. Then get into the root dir and type `meson build && cd build`. Then type `ninja` and be a ninja developer.
